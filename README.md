# Ecocompare
The world is facing substantial challenges regarding pollution, biodiversity resources and environmental sustainability.
We believe that consumers have a major role in buying products that are more respectful of people and the environment.
Ecocompare plateform uses a reliable and serious methodology to rate products on the environmental, social and sanitary axes in order to make them know to the largest audience.
Product information can be displayed on a mobile app or integrated on a web page though a widget application.
# Purpose
The goal of the https://www.ecocompare.com platform is to educate consumers by highlighting and explaining why one product is more environmentally friendly than another.
> Make our planet great again

# Methodology
The method of notation was carried out with students of the University Paris VII then with engineers of the Verteego company. This evaluation is based on an original and totally transparent methodology, called qualitative and positive.
Qualitative because instead of a black box that calculates impacts from activity data (for example, the consumption of energy, water, etc.) we verify in co-production with the manufacturer the validation of criteria given over the entire life cycle of the product (and packaging) as well as the societal and health aspects of it.
Positive because we value only the issues under control without blacklisting those who have yet to be worked.
